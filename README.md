Scraper.py

1. Requires two arguments "-Search" and "-File". Search is the string that searches Bing's query and -File specifies the name of the directory in which the found images will be saved in
2. If the directory already exists, the scraper will return an error message and exit
3. If the directory doesn't exist, the scraper will create a new directory in the same directory that the program is 	stored in
4. If no items are found, the program will throw an error (That I have yet to catch and handle)
